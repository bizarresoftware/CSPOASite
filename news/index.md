## CSPOA Lead Survey Results

In 2007, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources conducted a ground sampling survey in Cinnamon Square, searching for elevated levels of lead around the old mining/milling area near the swimming pool.

The area between the dirt mound and the tennis courts was found to have lead levels in excess of 3,000 parts per million. Per the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, concentrations of lead at this level pose a health risk, especially to children under 6 years of age.

This area was fenced off as soon as the high readings were found, and it remains fenced off at this time. The CSPOA Board is considering options to permanently eliminate potential contact with the contaminated soil in this area, e.g., removal and replacement of topsoil, landscaping over the top of the existing topsoil, or permanent fencing around the area.

[A letter from Missouri DHSS](/files/MissouriDHSSLeadContaminationSurveyResults.pdf) contains information regarding the sampling survey, lead toxicity, DHSS's assessment of our situation, and some recommendations for residents and the Association.
