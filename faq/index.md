## What is PayHOA?
PayHOA is a service that CSPOA uses to help us facilitate many aspects of the association.  You can use it to pay your dues, request pool parties, and submit architectural forms and other general inquiries.  Check it out at [https://app.payhoa.com/auth/join/7616-cinnamon-square](https://app.payhoa.com/auth/join/7616-cinnamon-square)!

## What is the association fee and what does it include?
The CSPOA association annual fee is $508 for Cinnamon Square, Cinnamon on the Hill, and the Cinnamon Townhomes. Residents benefit from the association dues with trash pickup (once a week), recycling, use of park, tennis courts, and pool, availability of pool and clubhouse for rental, private security patrol of neighborhood on Halloween night, and streets snow plowed, among other amenities.

## What fees are associated with the townhomes?
In addition to the CSPOA dues, the townhomes have additional dues and insurance payments.

Townhome 2018 annual dues are $2550 paid as annual lump sum. This covers property manager, C.P.A., townhome common area grounds/lawn care, snow removal from drives, common drive maintenance, and limited exterior maintenance as indicated in the Association by-laws. Each unit is owned, so maintenance is limited and is NOT like an apartment or condo unit where all maintenance is covered by the Association. The Association takes care of bigger items like roofing, siding, etc. However, it should be noted that if the original structure has been modified (e.g., decks, rooms, doors, windows/skylights, etc.), the Association is not responsible for the modifications or damages resulting from the modifications.

Each townhome owner also pays an insurance premium that covers the replacement of the unit to original construction. The amount varies yearly and is based upon the square footage of the unit and the annual premium. In 2017 this ranged from approximately $750 to $2200 depending on the unit size. The townhome owners are responsible for insurance deductibles. Each townhome owner is encouraged to carry their own additional insurance policy to cover any interior upgrades and contents as this is not covered by the Associations Policy.

The bylaws also allow for additional assessments. The most recent townhome assessment was for roof replacement and was paid in 2015 and 2016.

Failure to pay dues, insurance and/or assessments can result in late charges, attorneys fees, and/or a lien being placed on the property.
